## Utilizing Classification Algorithms for Animal Shelter Resources Allocation

### Introduction:
In this project classification algorithms had been used for optimizing resource allocation at the Dallas Animal Shelter. Data-driven approaches can significantly enhance animal welfare initiatives, leading to better outcomes for shelter animals and the community.

### Objective:
The objective is to demonstrate how classification algorithms can be applied to predict the outcome of animals entering the shelter system, thereby facilitating proactive resource allocation and decision-making.

### Problem Statement:
Animal shelters face numerous challenges, including limited resources and capacity constraints. Efficiently managing these resources while maximizing positive outcomes for animals is essential. By accurately predicting the outcomes of animals upon intake, shelters can better allocate resources such as staff time, medical care, and adoption efforts.

### Proposed Solution:
The proposed solution is to utilize classification algorithms to predict the outcomes of animals entering the Dallas Animal Shelter. By analyzing the data on animal characteristics, intake circumstances, and previous outcomes, we can develop a predictive model able to identifies the likely outcome for each animal. This proactive approach enables the shelter to allocate resources more effectively, prioritize interventions, and improve overall animal welfare.
